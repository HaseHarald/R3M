Random-Match-Making-Mailer or short R3M.

This little python tool sends everyone in a list a mail and assigns him or her a partner from that same list.

Usecase? Make one up. I wrote it for a special occasion around Christmas.

Yeah, ok, it's pretty useless. But who knows.

Be warned though. Since I had to finish this quite in a rush, there is still a lot of error-handling to be done.

You will require the following python packages for your python3:
- PyYAML
- smtplib
- unidecode
